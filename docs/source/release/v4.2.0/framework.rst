    putting new features at the top of the section, followed by
    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Concepts
--------

Algorithms
----------
* :ref:`LoadNGEM <algm-LoadNGEM>` added as a loader for the .edb files generated by the nGEM detector used for diagnostics. Generates an event workspace.
* :ref:`MaskAngle <algm-MaskAngle>` has an additional option of ``Angle='InPlane'``
* :ref:`FitIncidentSpectrum <algm-FitIncidentSpectrum>` will fit a curve to an incident spectrum returning the curve and it's first derivative.
* :ref:`CalculatePlaczekSelfScattering <algm-CalculatePlaczekSelfScattering>` will calculate the Placzek correction from an incident spectrum as generated by :ref:`FitIncidentSpectrum <algm-FitIncidentSpectrum>`.
* Whitespace is now ignored anywhere in the string when setting the Filename parameter in :ref:`Load <algm-Load>`.
* Added options to :ref:`SaveMD <algm-SaveMD>` to allow selection of what will be saved. For MDHistoWorkspace only.
* A new Poisson cost function has been added to :ref:`CalculateCostFunction <algm-CalculateCostFunction>`.
* New algorithm :ref:`SaveNexusESS <algm-SaveNexusESS>` to save data and nexus geometry to a single processed file.
* Version upgrade :ref:`LoadNexusProcessed <algm-LoadNexusProcessed>` to allow loading of both existing Mantid format Processed Nexus files and those produced via :ref:`SaveNexusESS <algm-SaveNexusESS>`.

Instrument Definition Files
---------------------------
* A definition file for the NEAT instrument at HZB as been added along with an entry in the facilities file.


Data Objects
------------
* New methods :py:obj:`mantid.api.SpectrumInfo.azimuthal` and :py:obj:`mantid.geometry.DetectorInfo.azimuthal`  which returns the out-of-plane angle for a spectrum

Live Data
---------
* Streaming of json geometry has been added to the KafkaLiveListener. User configuration is not required for this.
  The streamer automatically picks up the geometry as a part of the run information and constructs the in-memory geometry without the need for an IDF.

Python
------

API
---

It is now possible to have MultipleFileProperty configured in such a way, that it will allow empty placeholder tokens.

Bug Fixes
---------
* ref:`LoadNexusMonitors <algm-LoadNexusMonitors>` bug fix for user provided top-level NXentry name.
* ref:`LoadInstrument <algm-LoadInstrument>` correctly handles IDF files which use all lowercase naming.

:ref:`Release 4.2.0 <v4.2.0>`
